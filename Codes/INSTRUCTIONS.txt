Execution Instructions

1. Compile the code adc.c in AVR Studio and burn it on firebird. Note that
lcd.c should be present in the same folder as adc.c while compilation.
2. Mount the USB camera on firebird and keep it connected to pc-2. Attach
Xbee transmitter to pc-1. Keep the file Video.m on pc-2 and Xbee.m on pc-1.
Keep the localization shelter above the arena( around 8 ft ) so that the
system can calculate itâ€™s position while navigation.
3. Place firebird in the arena and switch it on. The bot will start to navigate in
arena. Run the programs Video.m and Xbee.m on respective machines. Keep
caution that the camera remains still on the bot till navigation is complete.
4. After the bot has navigated the arena sufficiently, stop the bot. Also stop the
programs Video.m and Xbee.m.
5. Two files Camera.txt and Xbee.txt will be formed on respective machines.
6. Get the two text files on one pc and run Combine.m with text files in same
folder. A new file Combine.txt will be created.
7. Run Map.m with file Combine.txt in the same folder and the map of the
arena will be drawn.
